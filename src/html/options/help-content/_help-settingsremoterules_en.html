<h3>Using rules and workflows setup by others</h3>
<p>
  If you want to use Form-O-Fill but do not want to write your own rules you can use rules written by others (eg. colleagues).<br/>
  These are called remote rules.<br />
  The only condition is that these rules must be available via http or https.<br />
  This is how you activate remote rules:
</p>
<p>
  <em>Step 1:&nbsp;</em> Have someone build the rules and workflows that you need locally inside Form-O-Fill.<br />
  <em>Step 2:&nbsp;</em> <a href="#importexport">Export</a> those rules a .js file<br />
  <em>Step 3:&nbsp;</em> Put them on a server and make them accessible via http or https<br />
  <em>Step 4:&nbsp;</em> Take the URL to the .js file and put it in the setting for <a href="#settings">"Activate remote rules import"</a><br />
  <em>Step 5:&nbsp;</em> Press <button class="save">Validate and import</button> and Form-O-Fill will report success or failure.
</p>
<p>
  Form-O-Fill will keep these rules in a separate storage and will auto-update those rules every ##Utils.alarmIntervalInMinutes## minutes.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Those rules will then also be used when searching for rules and workflow matches.<br />
  You can see which rules are remote rules by looking for a cloud icon in the rules popup:<br />

<h3>Using the on-click rules installer</h3>
<p>
  To make using remote rules even easier, you can use <a href="http://form-o-fill.github.io/import-remote-rules/">http://form-o-fill.github.io/import-remote-rules/</a> to generate a link that will
  auto-install your remote rules.
</p>
<p>
  This makes it easier to pass on those remote rules and make them usable for users that might not find it easy to follow the steps mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
  Visiting the generated link will import the remote rules and display a notification in the top right corner that fill report improt success or failure.
