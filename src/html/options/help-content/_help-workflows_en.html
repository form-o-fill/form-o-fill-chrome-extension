<h3>Workflows</h3>
<p>
  Workflows allow you to chain rules together to form sequences of actions.
</p>
<p>
  While a single rule can fill forms on a single page, workflows continue to execute even after a page reload.
</p>
<p>
  Use the "<a class="activate-menu" href="#workflows">Workflows</a>" menu on the left side to create workflows and add existing rules in an arbitary order.<br />
  You can drag and drop those workflow steps to reorder them.
</p>
<p>
  Notice that a workflow by itself doesn't submit any forms or changes or reloads the page url.<br />
  This is something you must do at the end of every rule.
</p>
<p>
  Usually you can archieve this by using a <a href="#help-functions">value function</a> that clicks on a link or button.
</p>
<p>
  Example rule that clicks on a submit button:
</p>
<pre>
  {
    name: "a clicking rule",
    url: /some-url/,
    fields: [{
      selector: "form input[type=submit]",
      value: Libs.h.click
    }]
  }
</pre>
<p>
  If you run a workflow and strange things happen (like you can't execute rules after that), try the
  <button class="wf-button-cancel">Cancel stuck workflow</button> button in the <a class="activate-menu" href="#workflows">Workflows</a> panel.
</p>
<h3>Executing workflows</h3>
<p>
  Once you have defined a workflow it will be shown in the rules popup <i>if the condition of the first rule in the workflow matches</i>.<br />
  Click on the workflow will execute it <br/>
  This is what the popup will look like:
